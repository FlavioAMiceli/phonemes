# phonemes

This is an esoteric project aiming to recreate what a given language sounds like.
Some of the inspiration for this project came from a video named skwerl.
In skwerl the characters speak some form of faux-english, that's meant to sound the way English sounds to non-speakers.
I want to create something like that for my own native language, since semantic understanding makes it very hard to experience the 'feel' of a language.

Also, I want to be able to confuse my friends and strangers at will.
